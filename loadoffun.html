  <h3>
Best known by its legacy as Load of Fun, 120 W. North </br>
Avenue closed in 2012 following an anonymous phone </br>
call placed to the city pointing to violations of fire code </br>
in the building. The closing was met with great controversy,</br>
as Load of Fun had served as artist studios and performance </br>
space for six years. Nearly three years after Load of Fun’s</br>
closing, the space again is being renovated, this time by</br>
BARCO as artist studios and retail space under the name “Motor House.”</br></br>

In the early twentieth century, 120 W. North Ave was </br>
occupied by a slew of automobile companies, including </br>
the Eastwick Motor Company, W. C. Coles Incorporated </br>
Auto Distribution, Jones Automobile Company, and Kernan </br>
Motor Sales. The building still stands as a testament to </br>
the importance of the automobile industry on the city’s</br>
economy for so many years; only a few blocks north on </br>
25th Street, Anderson of Baltimore, exclusively a full-</br>
service body shop since 2009, functioned as the final </br>
operating dealership in the area. The remains of another </br>
once-successful car dealership can be seen just a few </br>
blocks south at 1111 Maryland Ave, now housing the </br>
cleaning supply company Odorite.
</br></br>


Interspersed by periods of vacancy, the building at </br>
120 North Ave again changed hands in 1978 to house </br>
Lombard Office Furniture, a name and sign that would </br>
eventually be edited down to “Load of Fun” by early </br>
tenants Trixie Little and Evil Hate Monkey. Barry </br>
and Beatrice Gotthelf ran Lombard Office Furniture </br>
until 2005 when Sherwin Mark offered to purchase </br>
the space, transforming the labyrinth of shelves </br>
and office furniture into artist studios..
</br> </br>

Load of Fun is described as a utopian studio space</br>
by many ofits previous tenants, housing a variety</br>
of artists and performers in its studios with communal </br>
space for constant dialogue, interaction, and collaboration.</br>
Single Carrot Theatre, Make Studio, Baltimore Node </br>
Corporation, and What Weekly are just a small handful </br>
of projects that once occupied the space, all of whom </br>
have since found new spaces to continue their practice.
</br> </br>

Mara Neimanis is an aerial artist who performed, taught </br>
classes,and organized the Baltimore Alley Aerial Festival </br>
for three years during her time at Load of Fun.
</br> </br>

The Contemporary: What did the space provide for you?
</br> </br>
Mara Neimanis: It had to do with permission. Rigging </br>
permission,litigation. What Load of Fun was for me</br>
was an incredible foray into permission. Sherwin Marks </br>
ran the space when I was there. He gave me a lot of </br>
permission to do things that I really needed to do. </br>
I was paying for rent and I needed to do things so </br>
I had to get his green light.
</br> </br>
TC: Did the physical space contribute to its success?
</br> </br>
Mara Neimanis: Load of Fun was an incubator for </br>
innovative things that were not only happening in </br>
the city but happening for the city. There were </br>
large circular spaces on each level of the building,</br>
and [all of the artists] would meet and hang out and </br>
talk...The fact is that the building itself allowed for</br>
incredible meetings in the hallways. There were a bunch </br>
of photographers who had their own collective darkroom</br>
that Sherwin built, because he, too, was a photographer. </br>
When they were using it I would clean my dog off in the </br>
big sink. Sergio(?), from Station North, came from DC</br>
and fell in love with Load of Fun and Sherwin.
</br> </br>

He took the whole third floor and made it into a </br>
carpentry studio. Then he grew too big for the space.</br>
He threw parties on the roof, and they would have dinner </br>
parties in the middle of the gallery. You could join in, </br>
and these things were happening all the time….</br>
[Load of Fun] was very much a part of the pulse of life.</br>
It wasn’t like I went to the studio and then I went home. </br>
It was very much a part of everything. I think that most </br>
people would agree with that. Now I go to the studio and </br>
it’s a very separate place. In some respects it’s better, </br>
it’s great, that’s what you want in a studio.
