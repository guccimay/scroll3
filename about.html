  <h2> About Scroll 3: On Site
</br></br></br>

  <h3>
    Scroll 3: On Site offers a thorough excavation of a small </br>
    portion of Baltimore’s most influential yet uncelebrated </br>
    architecture; all of the spaces investigated still stand </br>
    today, though not all are active. Some have been transformed</br>
     into chain restaurants or corporate businesses, leaving </br>
     no trace of the unique projects they once housed.</br></br>

    Realizing that many arts conversations in Baltimore are</br>
    dominated by a single generation of voices, we set out</br>
    to interview cultural contributors from a variety of</br>
    generations. Our research spanned projects that have been</br>
    defunct for decades to projects inaugurated in the past year.</br>
    On Site utilizes eight case studies of properties that have</br>
    changed hands multiple times throughout their history to speak</br>
    to different aspects of Baltimore’s changing artistic, </br>
    financial,and cultural ecosystem. While we understand that </br>
    no single space can provide a comprehensive history of </br>
    Baltimore,our hope is that the projects explored begin to </br>
    provide some insight into the incredible projects that were</br>
    happening within Baltimore’s neighborhood in the 70s, 80s,</br>
    and 90s, as a way of contextualizing what is happening in </br>
    the present.</br></br>

    We have observed a peripheral blindness that occurs when</br>
    one’s understanding of a city is informed only by the brief</br>
    duration spent living there for school or work, and our hope</br>
    is that this issue of On Site acts as a reminder that even</br>
    the most innovatives ideas are built upon past experiments </br>
    and experiences.</br></br>

    Thank you to everyone who provided words, artifacts, photographs,</br>
    and memories of the various projects included in this issue of</br>
    Scroll. We hope that this publication functions as a catalyst to</br>
    further explore Baltimore’s extremely rich cultural landscape.</br></br>
