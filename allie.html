  <h2> On History, Naming, and Archiving
  <h3> Allie Linn </h3>

  <h3>

  Let this work function as an archive. </br></br>

  Archiving has become something of an obsession in the contemporary</br>
  art world, simultaneously operating as a tool for researching, </br>
  a method of working in the studio, and a curatorial strategy observed </br>
  in exhibitions and biennials worldwide. The term “archive” itself has </br>
  become rather nebulous, encompassing a wide variety of research and </br>
  cataloguing methods, but at its core, the value on collecting and storing </br>
  information has remained. The archive provides an accumulation of </br>
  historical records, and there seems to be something inherently hypnotizing </br>
  about stumbling upon a project from the past, especially when it feels </br>
  extremely relevant in the present tense. As the roles between artist, </br>
  curator, and writer become increasingly blurred, the term “archivist” </br>
  begins to extend beyond its traditional definition to include one who </br>
  sources material to create new content or even one who creates fictitious </br>
  content to invent narratives.</br> </br>

  In the 2008 exhibition “Archive Fever: Uses of the Document in </br>
  Contemporary Art” at the International Center of Photography, </br>
  Okwui Enwezor presents films, photography, and catalogued documents </br>
  to reflect on different means of creating narratives through archives, </br>
  whether actual or imaginary. By including artists like Felix Gonzalez-Torres, </br>
  Lorna Simpson, and Zoe Leonard, Ekwui is able to focus on extremely </br>
  personal and poetic narratives that still speak to more universal </br>
  concerns. Ekwui utilizes “the collection” to reference time passing </br>
  and memory shifting, especially in relation to periods of political </br>
  instability, war, and terror. The archive is explored through a very </br>
  different lens by Domenico Quaranta, whose 2012 exhibition “Collect </br>
  the WWWorld: The Artist as Archivist in the Internet Age” at 319 Scholes </br>
  focuses on the Internet as a tool for collecting, copying, re-appropriating, </br>
  networking, and producing for artists. Confronted by the surplus of </br>
  information and content available on the web and in physical publications, </br>
  family records, and public documents, it is unsurprising that we have </br>
  collectively become enamored with cataloguing the past and present </br>
  for some use in the future.</br> </br>

  Many rich archives exist to provide a peek into Baltimore’s history; </br>
  local projects like Baltimore Heritage, the Afro American, and the </br>
  Maryland Historical Society provide invaluable access to the history </br>
  of the community while much larger projects like the Internet Archive’s </br>
  Wayback Machine strive to archive every single webpage on the internet, </br>
  sometimes multiple times a day, to avoid content rot and broken links. </br>
  Were it not for the Wayback Machine, it would be next to impossible to </br>
  relocate Doreen Bolger’s poignant collection of art writing and criticism </br>
  on her Art-Full Life Blog that once existed as part of Charm City Current. </br>
  In an article for E-flux from 2013, Boris Groys writes, “Archives are </br>
  often interpreted as a means to conserve the past - to present the past in </br>
  the present. But at the same time, archives are machines for transporting </br>
  the present into the future. Artists always do their work not only for </br>
  their own time but also for art archives - for the future in which the </br>
  artist’s work remains present.”</br> </br>

  Consider BaltiGirls's Instagram, sophiajacob’s lecture series, or the</br>
  website created shortly after the 2015 uprisings to archive the wealth </br>
  of video, interviews, and photographs documenting the events following </br>
  the death of Freddie Gray. These projects create a territory for themselves </br>
  as they develop. Internet platforms allow even the most short-term or small </br>
  projects to be remembered. Szechuan Best, a curatorial project ran by Max </br>
  Guy and Peggy Chiang from 2010-2012, existed in multiple, mostly domestic </br>
  spaces, moving locations when Max and Peggy did. The name is drawn from </br>
  Peggy’s family’s late restaurant, and the website still presents a warm </br>
  review of the cuisine. Here, too, the name of the space itself acts as </br>
  a kind of archive, simultaneously paying homage to the Chiang family name, </br>
  revitalizing the name and history of the business, and continuing the project </br>
  as a curatorial practice. In the same way that Load of Fun provides a peek </br>
  into its history by working off the previous sign  (Lombard Office Furniture), </br>
  Szechuan Best references a bit of history, questioning the boundary between </br>
  gallery and business, artist-run space and trade.</br> </br>

  But if the archive’s job is to serve as a communal memory bank of a project </br>
  or time, maybe it is fitting that much of Baltimore’s arts landscape refuses </br>
  to be recorded. In researching spaces for this issue of Scroll, we stumbled </br>
  upon many memories of house galleries and domestic arts spaces that have </br>
  become nameless over time and elicit no results when entered in search engines. </br>
  The spaces that have managed to survive through newspaper clippings and </br>
  photographs tend to present an extremely whitewashed history of the city. </br>
  Partially because these projects seem to always have a faster turnover </br>
  rate than more commercial establishments and partially because the names </br>
  are often times so fluid, the only remaining remnants of the house gallery </br>
  are a casual photograph or a vague flyer. One of the things that dictates </br>
  Baltimore’s art community is turnover, and often, after a year or even a </br>
  few months, a project disappears without any trace. In a city where rent </br>
  is affordable and available, properties are often transformed into a </br>
  performance venue, gallery, show space, or bar, but only for a brief duration </br>
  before fading into a memory and reopening as something new.</br></br>

  Let this publication function as an archive of only a small sampling of spaces in </br>
  Baltimore that have housed countless now-forgotten projects and businesses.</br> </br>
