  <h3>
Now operating as a FedEx Kinko’s, 2 E. Redwood Street,</br>
nicknamed the “Hansa Haus,” retains its original German</br>
Renaissance architecture amidst the office buildings</br>
surrounding it. Harkening to the influx of immigrants</br>
from Germany to Locust Point in the early 20th century,</br>
the Hansa Haus was built in 1912 as the Baltimore office</br>
of the North German Lloyd Steamship Company, resembling</br>
“a half-timbered 16th-century German Rathaus, perhaps</br>
the Zwicken in Halberstadt.” Three stories high, the</br>
building was constructed in the North German architectural</br>
style and includes 39 coats of arms of Hanseatic on its</br>
stucco walls, and it remains surprisingly unchanged today. </br></br>

In 1973, the Baltimore Museum of Art opened the doors </br>
of the Hansa Haus to reveal the new Downtown Gallery. </br>
Owned by the Savings Bank of Baltimore at this point, </br>
the building provided a rent-free space for the museum </br>
to expand programming and enlarge audience. Downtown </br>
Gallery represented the country’s first satellite gallery </br>
andquickly attracted workers from the surrounding office  </br>
buildings with a variety of programs surrounding food,  </br>
dance, film screenings, and lectures to accompany the  </br>
exhibitions in the space. Roughly 36,000 people visited  </br>
the Downtown Gallery in its first year. The Downtown Gallery  </br>
has somehow since escaped the city’s memory, despite its  </br>
success, but remains unique in its accessibility and availability. </br> </br>


Brenda Edelson acted as the Director of Downtown Gallery  </br>
from 1971 until the gallery’s closure in 1975 when the  </br>
Savings Bank of Baltimore decided to move back into the  </br>
space. During that time, more than thirty exhibitions and  </br>
events occurred in the space. </br> </br>

The Contemporary: What were some of the most memorable  </br>
shows you organized?
 </br> </br>

Brenda Edelson: Toulouse Lautrec show and a photojournalism
show that was circulated by the Museum of Modern Art called
Behind the Picture Press. For the Toulouse Lautrec exhibition,
we had Linda Brown making crepes and can-can dancers in the
street, and it was great fun. I usually either had a speaker
or films that related to the exhibition.
 </br> </br>

TC: Were there any other exciting projects going on </br>
nearby at the time?
</br></br>
BE: The Downtown Gallery was wonderful, but it takes </br>
a lot of energy and money, and nobody has it today to </br>
do that sort of thing. George Dalsheimer ran a beautiful</br>
gallery downtown on Charles Street and they were open</br>
quite a while, and then I had a gallery briefly on </br>
Charles Street, after I left the museum with a partner, </br>
and we showed contemporary prints.. The Dalsheimer Gallery</br>
had world class photography exhibits, and it went on for</br>
probably ten years. I would think it closed around 1985.</br>
We showed contemporary fine prints, so we had shows of work
from Frank Stella. I just did not enjoy the gallery business. </br></br>

We had a Frankenthaler show, a Hockney show, a Motherwell show.
It was during the print boom, when prints were getting bigger
and more expensive, and we had a very good success, I just did
not like retail, doing it that way. I became a private dealer
afterwards. The Baltimore Museum also had a wonderful Sales
and Rentals Gallery, and it was for many years a very successful
program that got a lot of people in Baltimore collecting.
They could rent a print for three months at a time and then
buy it or return it. It gave them chance to see how they
liked living with something. Wonderful print shows, photography
shows, drawing shows. It was a great effort. But it was before
things got so very expensive. It was during the years when things
were more affordable and approachable.</br></br>

Another 1974 exhibition entitled, “Highlights from the Atlanta
University Collection of Afro-American Art,” presented work
from the High Museum’s collection, which boasted the largest
number of works by contemporary black artists at the time.
Hale Woodruff, Vivian Williams, Henry O. Tanner, Elizabeth Catlett,
and Jacob Lawrence are among over sixty artists presented.
Supported by the Baltimore Afro, the exhibition was supplemented
with gallery talks, lectures, and two film series, “Of Black
America” and “Black Artists in America.”
